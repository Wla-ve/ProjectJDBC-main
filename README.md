## Project JDBC

Done first part of two, w8 for a response.

Problems list:
- [ ] too much repeating code snippet try-wit-resources 
when need a new statement - is it okay? Don't guess so...
- [x] each method got a new connection to DB, okay...
- [ ] all JUnit test passed, but I've got a sense, that it is
too complicated - about code logic...
